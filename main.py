"""
main.py - Unisport Sample webservice

The general layout and semantic of the application is generalized where I thought possible,
    and put into context of each endpoint.
This is done to further the understanding of the process the data goes through,
    which is very much the same at each endpoint.

The endpoints are:
/products
/products/kids
/products/<id>

The endpoints /products and /products/kids also have the ability the take in a page query-parameter,
    which will return the requested page, if it exists, e.g: /products?page=2
All the endpoints will 404, if any query or request is validated falsy.
This is done because I believe standard 404 errors should be a part of a standard API design.

I believe the specific requirements of the web service have been met.
The original repo and said requirements can be found here: https://github.com/unisport/sample

Extra:

If I would have had more time on my hands, I would've implemented a SQLAlchemy model Product(),
which would serve as a backend connection. I would then make a RESTful implementation of the webservice.
This way any user of the web service API could create, read, update, and delete products as they would see fit.
This could further be extended to use some kind of frontend framework, which would handle these requests.
Or you could use XHR. Or even another server, which would serve pages with forms to edit and delete products, etc.

One possibility would be to design the project with Flask blueprints. A blueprint which would point to /,
which would serve the frontend for easy-to-use editing, etc. of products. Another blueprint for /products,
which would serve up the web service as made here. Of course with the SQLAlchemy backend in mind.
