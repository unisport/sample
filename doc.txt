Simple Python Webservice

Routes:

/products/ - returns first 10 products(cheapest first)
/products/?page={num} - returns another 10 products etc.(cheapest first)
/products/kids/ - returns all the products with kids parameter = 1(cheapest first)
/products/{id}/ - returns details of the single product

Requirements:
web.py - the most lightweight, simple python framework for building webservices
paste - tool which helps in the tests, give a possibility to create a requests in tests
requests - I like it more than urllib ;)
