This version uses Python 2.6 and Django 1.5.1

**1. manage.py syncdb**
**2. manage.py build_db** - This builds the DB with items from JSON

Visit **/products/product-list/** for a list of products from the DB. There are also links to product json, editing and deleting.

You can also visit the links given in the assignment description:

/products/
/products/?page=2
/products/kids/
/products/id/

You can add parameter "items" to /products/?page= calls, to get a specific amount of items returned (5, 10, 14 etc.)
