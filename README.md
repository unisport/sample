Write a simple python webservice that returns the objects & manipuates the data found here [http://www.unisport.dk/api/sample/](http://www.unisport.dk/api/sample/).


**/products/**  


should return the first 10 objects ordered with the cheapest first.
 
**/products/kids/**
 
should return the products where kids=1 ordered with the cheapest first

**/products/?page=2**
 
 The products should be paginated where **page** in the url above should return the next 10 objects  

 **/products/id/**
 
should return the individual product.


 
**_Remember to test_**   
**_Remember to document (why, not how)_**

####Bonus:
 extend the service so the products can also be created, edited and deleted in a backend of choice.
